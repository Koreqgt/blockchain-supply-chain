# Blockchain Supply Chain

A decentralized supply chain application built with Solidity, Hardhat, and Next.js. This project demonstrates how suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers can track goods on a blockchain from start to finish.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a transparent and secure supply chain system where each party (supplier, manufacturer, distributor, retailer) interacts with smart contracts to record and verify transactions. The front end is built with Next.js, while the back end uses Hardhat for contract development, testing, and deployment.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity** for writing smart contracts  
- **Hardhat** for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts  
- **Ethers.js** for interacting with Ethereum networks  
- **Next.js** for the front-end application  
- **Node.js** & **npm** for package management

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (Root / Hardhat)**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs the dependencies listed in the root `package.json`, including Hardhat and other tooling.

3. **Compile Contracts**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

   This command compiles all the Solidity contracts inside the `contracts/` directory. Compiled artifacts will be placed in the `artifacts/` folder.

---

## Local Development

### 1. Start a Local Ethereum Node (Optional)

If you want to test locally with Hardhat’s built-in node:

```bash
npx hardhat node (get RPC URL and creates wallets)
```

```bash
npx hardhat accounts (View the wallets by running)
```

This will start a local Ethereum network on `http://127.0.0.1:8545` with predefined accounts and private keys.

### 2. Deploy Contracts to Local Network

In a separate terminal (while the Hardhat node is running), deploy your contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

**Note**: You can also deploy to other networks (e.g., Ropsten, Goerli, etc.) by configuring `hardhat.config.js` and replacing `--network localhost` with the desired network name.

### 3. Contract Addresses & ABIs

After deployment, take note of the deployed contract addresses. Your front end will need these addresses and the ABI from the `artifacts/` folder to interact with the contracts.

---

## Testing

Hardhat uses Mocha and Chai for testing. You can write tests in the `test/` directory. To run all tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

---

## Front End

The front end is located in the `frontend/` directory and is built with Next.js.

1. **Install Front-End Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment (Optional)**

   If your front end needs environment variables (e.g., Infura API keys, contract addresses), you can create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend/` directory:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0xYourDeployedContractAddress"
   ```

   Make sure to reference this in your Next.js code as `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

3. **Run the Next.js Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts the dev server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes to your code automatically reload the page.

---

## Deployment to Testnet or Mainnet

1. **Update `hardhat.config.js`**

   In your Hardhat config, add a network configuration for your desired testnet (e.g., Goerli) or mainnet. Example:

   ```js
   networks: {
     goerli: {
       url: "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY",
       accounts: [`0x${YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY}`]
     },
     // ...
   },
   ```

2. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```

3. **Update Front End**

   - Take note of the new contract address.
   - Update your front-end environment variables or config to use the correct address and network.

4. **Build & Export Next.js** (Optional, for production)

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

   This creates an optimized production build. You can also deploy this build to hosting services like Vercel or Netlify.
